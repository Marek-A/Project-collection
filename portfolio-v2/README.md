## Portfolio V2
This is the code for my personal website portfolio version 2, built using React. This repository includes several components that make up the website, each with its own specific functionality and features.

## Home Component
The Home component of this React app includes the use of the Typed.js library to create a typewriter effect for a dynamic text element, as well as the ScrollReveal library to add scrolling animations to different elements on the page. It also includes a function to copy an email address to the clipboard when a button is clicked.

## About Component
The About component in this React application includes a new handleLinkClick function that smooth scrolls to a specific section of the page, and a new button link to the portfolio page. The component also has improved styling and new content that provides more details about the developer's journey with coding.

## Portfolio Component
The Portfolio component of this React app displays a section showcasing several projects. Each project is presented with an image, a brief description, and a link to the project's GitHub repository. The component also includes CSS files for styling and media queries.

## Contact Component
The Contact component of this React app uses the emailjs library to handle sending email from a contact form. It includes form validation and implements logic to copy the email address to the clipboard on button click. The component also includes social links for LinkedIn, GitHub, and Facebook.

## Navbar Component
The Navbar component of this React app is a responsive navbar with smooth scrolling functionality. It allows users to navigate to different sections of the website using links in the navbar and highlights the currently active section as the user scrolls through the page.
